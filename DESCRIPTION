Description: Computes compatibility (confidence) distributions along with their corresponding P-values,
    S-values, and likelihoods. The intervals can be plotted to form the distributions themselves.  
    Functions can be compared to one another to see how much they overlap. Results can be
    exported to Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and TeX documents. The package currently supports 
    resampling methods, computing differences, generalized linear models, mixed-effects models, 
    survival analysis, and meta-analysis. These methods are discussed 
    by Schweder T, Hjort NL. (2016, ISBN:9781316445051) and 
    Rafi Z, Greenland S. (2020) <doi:10.1186/s12874-020-01105-9>.
